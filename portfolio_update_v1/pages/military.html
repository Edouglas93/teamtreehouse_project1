      <h1>My Journey into Manhood</h1>
      <img src="../images/airforce.jpg" alt="randomly generated technology reference pictures">
      <p>I am an aspiring web developer who is using team treehouse to build my skills using the front-end web development tech degree that they offer. My goal is to complete the front-end tech degree in six months so I can have a strong portfolio showing off my skills and to start applying to jobs. In addition to completing that tech degree I plan on doing the Java script tech degree as well. To my understanding, while doing due diligence on front-end web development, Html, CSS, and JavaScript are the minimum languages to master in order to be an effective developer.</p> 
      <p>In addition to the tech degree, I am also pursing my associates of science in web development at a local community college. The course work in addition to the tech degree workload complement each other well. Once landing my first job or completing my degree, which ever comes first, I plan to purse learning backend development languages to become a full stack developer. As well as pursing a bachelorâ€™s in computer science at Arizona State University.</p>
