          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who understands that our world is becoming an ever more technology dependent and through coding would love to leave an impactful digital footprint. Prior to this my only other career job has been the military which gave me the ability to travel, learn soft skils such as leadership, time managment, and stragetic thinking all while serving my country. I feel privileged to add my unique touch and perspective to the web development community. In addition to serve my future clients’ needs to their satisfaction and individual needs. </p>
          <p>I am some who prides themselves on humility and having a growth mind-set. I identify with being a life-long learner who's always interested in expanding my skills. Everyday I read or listen to non-ficiton books to gain more knowledge in a specific area of my life where I feel needs the most improvement, my favorite author being Robert Greene. Being a web developer fits perfectly with my identify becuase of the exponential growth of technology as well as the mass amount of languages and nuanced of each language developers have to consistently learn in order to stay effective.</p>
