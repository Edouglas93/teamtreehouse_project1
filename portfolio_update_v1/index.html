          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I am an aspiring web developer who understands that our world is becoming an ever more technology dependent especially in the United States. My personal goal while being a software engineer is to leave an impactful digital footprint. Prior to this my only other career job has been the Air Force, which I served 6 years from the age of 19 to 25 years old. During that time, I had the opportunity to travel and learn soft skills which included leadership, time management, and strategic thinking all while serving my country. I feel privileged to add my unique touch and perspective to the web development community. In addition, I look forward to applying my skills in a manner that will properly serve my future clients’ needs to their satisfaction. </p>
          <p>I am some who prides themselves on humility and having a growth mind-set. I identify with being a life-long learner who's always interested in expanding my skills. Everyday I read or listen to non-ficiton books to gain more knowledge in a specific area of my life where I feel needs the most improvement, my favorite author being Robert Greene. Being a web developer fits perfectly with my identify becuase of the exponential growth of technology as well as the mass amount of languages and nuanced of each language developers have to consistently learn in order to stay effective.</p>
